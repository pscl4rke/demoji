This package is a minimally thin wrapper script around the
[emoji](https://pypi.org/project/emoji/)
library.
It exists to put a command on your `$PATH` which can decode
the pictogram unicode characters known as "emoji" into
plain-text explanatory text.
Including when embedded in an ordinary message.

(It is completely unrelated to the PyPI library with
[the same name](https://pypi.org/project/demoji/).)
